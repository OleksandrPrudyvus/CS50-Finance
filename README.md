# CS50-Finance
This project is the final step towards completing the Harvard course "CS50- Introduction to Computer Science".
In this course, we studied programming languages such as C / C ++ Python, and the language of interaction with SQL databases.
There was also the first acquaintance with web programming and writing the first website using the microframework-Flask.
